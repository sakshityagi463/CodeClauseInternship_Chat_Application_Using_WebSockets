# CodeClauseInternship_Chat_Application_Using_WebSockets
I developed this chat app using JavaScript & WebSocket. This app allow you to communicate with the client. It enables the client to send or receive the messages .
Also if the client join or leave the chat it will inform the other client's that someone join or leave the chat.
