# CodeClauseInternship_Chat_Application_Using_WebSockets
I developed this chat app using JavaScript & WebSocket. This app allows you to communicate with the client. It enables the client to send or receive messages.
Also if the client joins or leaves the chat it will inform the other clients that someone has joined or leave the chat.
